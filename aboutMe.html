    <p class="card1-text">My interest in the IT industry began during my school years at Belmont Academy. I chose Computing at Standard Grade and followed it through to Advanced Higher. From there my interest grew and I decided to further my education and study Computer Games Technology at University. Throughout university I was part of many group projects, these were done in a variety of technologies, Visual Studio and Unity. In my final year at university I wrote a research paper on the difference between Scripted and Procedural Level Design and what the effect each of these has on immersion. This was a fantastic opportunity to fully build a project from the ground up and draw conclusions based on empirical evidence. The nature of my degree allowed me to become a very analytical-minded individual and also made me very keen in pursuing a job in a technology-based environment.   
After University I decided to work in the computing field, specialising in the software side of the industry. I enjoy the problem solving aspect of programming and the comradery that comes from working in a team.

    <h2 class="card3-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">QA Consulting</h2>
    <p class="card3-text">One of the first projects that I did while training at QA was to evaluate a fictional company and create solutions to the problems the company were having. This was done to introduce myself and my colleagues to the reality of working for a client and the challenges we could face. The process of the project was to evaluate a case study, followed by conducting interviews with various members of staff throughout the company to find information about the issues they were facing with their current systems and processes. Then solutions were developed, followed by a pitch to the clients where the objective is to sell your ideas to them. I found this project gave a great insight into what it is like to work as a consultant and I have learned important skills such as interview techniques, presentation skills and analysing a business.
The next few weeks were spent learning Java, the main concept focused on during this time was Object Oriented Programming. I used this concept to create various projects from a calculator, to a library system. Some other concepts that were also used were streams, test driven development and design patterns. To further develop my soft skills, I did a presentation which detailed the workings of the builder pattern. This involved going through the problem that the builder pattern addresses as well as a code example.
MySQL was the next thing that I learned, that involved populating databases and querying them for specific data. This involved simple queries like displaying a table to more complex ones such as retrieving data based on a variety of criteria. The next step in using databases was to begin building simple APIs. My first API I created was a simple database that interacted with a web browser to utilise CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The database contained details on films, films could be added updated and deleted. Finally, postman was used to test this API in various ways.

        My hobbies include sports, video games and reading. The sport I enjoy playing the most is football and have been playing since I was very young. I also enjoy basketball, table tennis and volleyball. I played volleyball at university and basketball at high school but haven’t been able to take them any further than that. To relax I play a lot of video games and in my spare time still like to make games using Unity and Unreal Engine. My love of reading is a more recent hobby which started with the game of thrones series and from that point on I have been reading any fantasy novels I can get my hands on.
Another hobby of mine is drawing (mostly pencil art) and I have made an Instagram page where I post some of the work I have done. I mainly draw comic and video game characters as I find the design of them very interesting.
